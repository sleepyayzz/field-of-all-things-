TL;DR:
This is a modern mythology built with scientific language. Its core ideas:

The Field: A quantum substrate underpinning all realities, with six resonant frequencies (Consciousness, Information, Time, Matter, Space, Energy).

Fiction as Communication: Stories are transmissions from alternate dimensions, not mere inventions.

The Narrative Trinity: All stories—and all conscious perception—are built from three elements: Plot (the circumstance), Protagonist (the observer), Antagonist (the mystery).

The Recursive Proof: The theory predicts that engaging with it will alter your perception, making you a data point in its own validation. Your curiosity is not accidental; it's the theory working as intended.

This is not a scientific claim. It is a philosophical framework designed to re-enchant your understanding of reality, story, and mind.
