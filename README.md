> **Disclaimer:** This is a philosophical thought experiment and modern mythology presented in the language of science. It is not a scientific paper seeking empirical validation but a framework for exploring the nature of consciousness, story, and reality.

### Abstract
This theory proposes that a fundamental substrate, termed **The Field of All Things**, underlies all reality. From this Field emerge six resonant frequencies governing existence (Consciousness, Information, Temporal, Material, Spatial, Energy). The theory further posits that what we perceive as "fiction" is a form of interdimensional communication via this Field, and that consciousness itself operates through a fundamental **Trinity of Narrative** (Plot, Protagonist, Antagonist) observable in any act of perception.

### The Recursive Proof
This theory predicts the **Observer Recursion Effect**â€”that engaging with these ideas integrates the observer into the narrative framework described. By reading this, you are participating in the theory's actualization.
